#### Step 1: Browse Assets and Strategies

Expand each trading pair to explore the top 10 grid strategies set up by our top strategists. The list is sorted by TVL by default. Under each asset, the trading bots are then sorted by the total APR.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are different directions for a bot, including **`Long`**, **`Short`**, **`Neutral`**, and **`Enhanced Neutral`**. Please read more about how these different types work at [grid-bot.md](../../fundamentals/grid-bot.md "mention") section.
{% endhint %}
