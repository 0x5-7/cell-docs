# Overview

## What is Cell?

Welcome to Cell, a Smart Automated Market Maker (SAMM) that democratizes liquidity provision for Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEXs. By building a bot infrastructure that enables anyone to seamlessly create gird trading strategies and deposit assets into boosted farms, Cell aims to become the liquidity gateway for CLOBs.

## What is the point of Cell?

We truly believe that the flexibility of CLOBs decides its superiority over traditional AMMs. However providing liquidity on CLOBs has higher barrier, which results in high slippage compared to CEXs and much less trading pairs compared to AMMs. Cell closes this gap by providing a simple, flexible, and automated tool that enables the mass to provide liquidity like pros.

Cell also pioneered an innovative **Range-based Farm** that redefines incentive accuracy. It empowers projects to incentivize concentrated liquidity with customized ranges, and let liquidity flow to where it is needed the most.

## Who can benefit from Cell?

Whoever you are, there is a special space for you to explore and participate.

> **Liquidity providers** can seamlessly create or copy grid LP strategies like pro market makers, and capture high APY from price fluctuation.

> **Crypto projects** can accurately incentivize community LPs with native tokens, and build products atop with our highly-composable modules.

> **CLOBs** can enjoy lower slippage, better depth, and more markets.
